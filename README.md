# xcode-project-scaffold

Create a new Xcode project reproducibly, from a single version-controlled configuration file.

```text
scaffold.yml  →  xscaffold init  →  a project that builds, tests and lints
```

---

## ⚠️ Status: early — all four commands work

`init`, `validate`, `plan` and `doctor` are implemented, with `--output json`
and the exit codes below. Both v0.1 variants — UIKit and SwiftUI — are
generated, built and tested against a simulator on every push; a separate job
checks that generated sources pass the linters they ship with.

What is left for v0.1 is the bundled Skill with its schema reference.

Track the scope and milestones in
[`docs/plans/xcode-project-scaffold-plan.md`](docs/plans/xcode-project-scaffold-plan.md).

## ⚠️ Stability: none during 0.x

The `scaffold.yml` schema, the CLI contract, the JSON output format and the
error codes **may change without notice, and without a migration path, for the
entire 0.x series.** Do not build automation against them yet.

Stability guarantees, a Homebrew tap and a template compatibility policy are
deferred until 1.0.

## What it is

`xscaffold` turns a declarative description of an Xcode project into a real
one — source files, `project.yml`, lint and format configuration, a `Makefile`,
build environments and a git repository — and guarantees that the same
configuration produces the same project.

It is designed to be driven three ways:

```bash
xscaffold init --preset ios-uikit MyApp        # presets
xscaffold init --config scaffold.yml           # declarative
                                               # or by an AI agent, via the
                                               # bundled Skill, which writes
                                               # scaffold.yml and calls the CLI
```

The machine-readable path is a first-class use case, not an afterthought:
every command supports `--output json` and returns a meaningful exit code.

## What it deliberately does not do

The tool's boundary is **project creation**. It does not manage projects it did
not create, and it does not manage a project after creation:

- No regeneration, no template upgrades, no config migration
- No ownership manifest or file checksums
- No `inspect` / `import` of existing projects
- No `add feature` / `add package` / `add integration`
- No Objective-C or mixed-language project creation

Once a project is generated, `project.yml` becomes its source of truth and
`xscaffold` steps out of the way. `scaffold.yml` remains only as a record of
how the project was created.

The reasoning, and what it costs, is recorded in
[ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-scaffold-yml-as-birth-certificate.md).

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| macOS | Apple silicon or Intel, with Xcode installed |
| Xcode | 26.x (developed and tested against 26.4) |
| Swift toolchain | 6.0 or later (developed and tested against 6.3) |
| [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) | required at generation time; `xscaffold` fails with exit code 10 if it is missing |

`xscaffold` calls XcodeGen as a subprocess and does not vendor it. Generated
projects also expect XcodeGen to be available, since `.xcodeproj` is a derived
artifact and is git-ignored.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/g761007/xcode-project-scaffold.git
cd xcode-project-scaffold
make install          # swift build -c release, then copy to ~/.local/bin
```

Override the destination with `make install PREFIX=/usr/local`.

There is no pre-built binary distribution during 0.x. Binaries downloaded from
the internet are quarantined by Gatekeeper unless signed with a Developer ID
and notarised, which is disproportionate at this stage. Building from source
avoids the problem entirely, and the target audience already has a Swift
toolchain.

## Usage

```bash
xscaffold init MyApp --preset ios-uikit       # create a project
xscaffold validate scaffold.yml               # check a configuration
xscaffold plan MyApp --preset ios-uikit       # show what init would create
xscaffold doctor                              # check the tools init needs
```

```text
--config <path>        a scaffold.yml to generate from
--preset <name>        ios-uikit or ios-swiftui
--destination <path>   where to create the project (default: ./<name>)
--output <text|json>   how to report the result
--dry-run              show what init would create, and stop
--force                write into a destination that is not empty
--skip-git             do not create a git repository
--skip-generate        do not run XcodeGen
--validate-build       build the generated project before reporting success
```

`plan` and `init --dry-run` are the same implementation under two names, and
take the same options, so a preview cannot disagree with the run it previews.

`doctor` separates what a default `init` cannot do without — `git` and
`xcodegen` — from what only the generated project needs: `xcodebuild` for
`make test`, `swiftformat` and `swiftlint` for `make lint`. Only a missing
requirement exits 10; the rest are reported and shrugged at.

Pass exactly one of `--config` or `--preset`. The positional name sets
`project.name`; with `--preset` it is required, because a preset says nothing
about the project's identity. A preset derives the bundle identifier as
`com.example.<name>` — it is written into the generated `scaffold.yml`, where
you can change it. Use `--config` when it has to be right from the start.

Execution behaviour lives in flags, never in `scaffold.yml` — the configuration
file describes the *project*, not a particular run.

Generating into a destination that already exists and is not empty fails with
exit code 6; `--force` writes into it anyway, replacing files the plan produces
and leaving everything else alone. **xscaffold only ever deletes what it
created:** if a run fails after creating the destination, the destination is
removed; if the destination was already there, it is left as it is and the
error says so.

### Machine-readable output

`--output json` puts one JSON document on stdout and nothing else; anything a
person would read goes to stderr. Failures produce a document too — that is
when a caller needs it most:

```console
$ xscaffold validate scaffold.yml --output json
{"command":"validate","exitCode":0,"issues":[],"ok":true}

$ xscaffold doctor --output json | jq '.checks[] | select(.found == false)'
```

`ok`, `command` and `exitCode` are always present, and `message` on failure.
`issues`, `plan`, `checks` and `destination` appear only when that command has
them to report — an absent key, never `null`. `plan` carries file paths and
sizes, not file contents.

### Exit codes

```text
0   success                        6   file conflict
1   unexpected failure             7   generation failure
2   invalid CLI arguments          8   external command failure
3   configuration parsing failure  9   build validation failure
4   configuration validation       10  environment requirement missing
5   template resolution failure
```

### Minimal `scaffold.yml`

```yaml
schemaVersion: 1

project:
  name: MyApp
  organizationName: My Company
  bundleIdentifier: com.example.myapp

product:
  platform: ios
  type: application
  deploymentTarget: "18.0"

language:
  primary: swift
  languageMode: "6"

interface:
  primary: uikit
  lifecycle: app-delegate-scene-delegate

architecture:
  pattern: minimal

generator:
  type: xcodegen

environments: []

quality:
  swiftlint: true
  swiftformat: true

testing:
  unit: swift-testing

git:
  defaultBranch: main
```

The full field reference is in
[`docs/plans/xcode-project-scaffold-plan.md`](docs/plans/xcode-project-scaffold-plan.md) §4.

Note that `language.languageMode` is Xcode's `SWIFT_VERSION` build setting — a
*language mode*, whose only valid values are `5` and `6`. It is not a compiler
or toolchain version.

## Development

```bash
make build            # swift build
make test             # swift test
make e2e              # generate, build and test both variants
make lint             # swiftformat --lint and swiftlint --strict
make format           # apply formatting in place
make install          # release build, installed to $PREFIX/bin
```

`make lint` needs `swiftlint` and `swiftformat` on the PATH
(`brew install swiftlint swiftformat`). CI installs them itself.

`make e2e` creates a project from each preset with the freshly built binary —
which runs XcodeGen as part of `init` — then builds and tests it against a
simulator. It needs `xcodegen` on the PATH and a git identity, and it prints
which simulator it chose, for the reason below. CI runs it on every push.

When invoking `xcodebuild` locally, **always pass an unambiguous destination.**
A device name alone matches several simulators across installed runtimes, and
`xcodebuild` will pick one arbitrarily:

```bash
# ambiguous — do not do this
-destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'

# unambiguous
-destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16,OS=18.0'
-destination 'id=<simulator-udid>'
```
